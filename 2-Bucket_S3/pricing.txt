############################################################

GET requests: GET requests are made when you retrieve an object from an S3 bucket.
This could be when you download a file from an S3 bucket using the aws s3 cp command
or when a user accesses a file stored in S3 via a web browser or application.

PUT requests: These requests are made when you upload an object to an S3 bucket.
For example, when you use the aws s3 cp command to copy a file to an S3 bucket,
a PUT request is generated.

DELETE requests: DELETE requests are made when you delete an object from an S3 bucket.
This could be triggered by using the aws s3 rm command or through programmatic deletion.

LIST requests: These requests are made when you list the objects within a bucket.
For example, when you use the aws s3 ls command to list the contents of a bucket,
LIST requests are generated.

COPY requests: COPY requests occur when you copy an object from one location to another
within the same bucket or between different buckets.

POST requests: POST requests are typically used for form submissions or uploading
data directly to S3 using HTML forms.

HEAD requests: HEAD requests are similar to GET requests, but they only retrieve
the object's metadata (e.g., size, content type) without retrieving the actual
object content.
